In the original instances, the production cost for each generator $g\\in G$ is modelled as a convex piecewise-linear function described by the parameters $c^0_g$, the cost of producing the minimum amount of power, and $c^1_g,\\ldots ,c^k_g$, the costs of producing each additional MW of power within the piecewise interval $k$. In addition, each generator has a startup cost $c^s_g$. In our data analysis, we observed that the daily changes in bid prices rarely exceeded $\\pm 5\\%$. Therefore, random numbers $\\alpha_g$ were independently drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval $\\left[0.95,1.05\\right]$, for each generator $g\\in G$, and the costs of $g$ were linearly scaled by this factor. That is, the costs for generator $g$ were set to $\\alpha_g c^0_g, \\alpha_g c^1_g, \\ldots  \\alpha_g c^k_g, \\alpha_g c^s_g$. "

In order to generate realistic distribution for these parameters, we analyzed hourly demand data from PJM (2018). More specifically, we computed the mean $\\mu_t$ and variance\n",

    " $D_1,\\ldots ,D_{24}$. Therefore, in addition to these parameters, a random number $\\rho$, corresponding to the peak system load $\\max\\{D_1,\\ldots D_{24}\\}$, was also generated. In the original instances, the peak system load is always $60\\%$ of the total capacity. Based on our data analysis, we observed that the actual peak load rarely deviates more than $\\pm 7.5\\%$ from the day-ahead forecast. Therefore, to generate instance variations,$\\rho$ was sampled from the uniform distribution in the interval $\\left[0.6 \\times 0.925C, 0.6\\times 1.075C\\right]$, where $C$ is the total capacity. Note that the $\\rho$ and $\\gamma'$ are now sufficient to construct $D_1,\\ldots D_{24}$. Figure 1 shows a sample of some artificially generated load profiles.\n",

For strategies $\\tt{zero}$, $\\tt{tr}$ and $\\tt{tr-ws}$, CPLEX was configured to use a relative MIP gap tolerance of $0.1\\%$.
